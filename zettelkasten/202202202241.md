*Occam's Razor* suggests that if there are multiple explanations for the same
*phenomenon, the one that
has the least number of assumption should be chosen. Mistakenly, it is sometimes
said that the simplest should be chosen but it is wrong. Simple does not mean
the least number of assumptions. For example creationism is simpler than
evolution but it assumes a creator which is a huge and unnecessary requirement.
Evolution, on the other hand, explains the variety of life on earth easily
without the assumption of a creator.

In another way Occam's razor ignores the parts of a theory which cannot be
observed. If you cannot observe a thing you cannot measure and experiment with it.
