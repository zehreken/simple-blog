Spaced repetition is a method for keeping information in the long term memory which can also be
called memorising. The method involves flash cards. The flash cards are assigned to a number of
boxes based on the subject's ability to remember the cards. The less remembered a card is, the
often that card is shown. It can be considered as an activity in the [metacognition](202201170157.html) domain.

It is not an integral part of the Zettelkasten method but it can be employed at least for
remembering the titles of the notes.
