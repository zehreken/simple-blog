Can be described as the relationship between employee and employer or elected
officials and citizens, the former being the agent and the latter being the
principal. The problem arises when each part has different interests as in when
the action that is to the best interest of the principal can be costly for the
agent and it is very difficult for the principal to observe the decisions of the
agent.
