Seborrhoeic dermatitis is a condition of the skin. It is an auto-immune disease. It is mostly visible around the nose, the scalp, around and under eyebrows, around and under mustache, around chin.
Blepharitis is a condition of the eyelids. They become red and swollen. I remember being asked many times in the past 15 years that why my eyelids are red and swollen.
