Intermittent fasting is an important tool to regain health, especially when one has chronic illnesses like seborrheic dermatitis, eczema or arthritis. There are different ways of doing intermittent fasting. The most common method is 16-8, which means fasting for 16 hours a day and eating in an 8 hour period. There are also longer fasting types like 24, 48 or even 72 hour fastings.
