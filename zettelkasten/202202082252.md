lim(f(x)) = L where x->a means, f(x) can be made as close to L as desired if x is close enough to a.

The limit of a sum is the sum of the limits, provided the limits exist. 
lim(f(x) + g(x)) = lim(f(x)) + lim(g(x))

lim(sin(1/x)) where x->0 does not exist but

lim(sin(x)/x) where x->0 is 1 because of the
[Squeeze Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squeeze_theorem)

The limit of the products is the product of the limits, provided the limits exist.
lim(f(x) * g(x)) = lim(f(x)) * lim(g(x))

The limit of the quotient is the quotient of the limits, provided the limits exist and the denominator
is not 0.
lim(f(x) / g(x)) = lim(f(x)) / lim(g(x)), lim(g(x)) != 0
