Metacognition means thinking about thinking, being aware of one's tought processes.
It is especially important when it comes to learning new concepts just by reading.
It turns out that I don't remember much of what I read, even though at the time of reading
I think I understand the concept. Metacognition comes very handy but it also makes things
complicated and takes extra time. For example just pausing and thinking about what has been read,
taking notes or discussing it with others are metacognitive activities.
Zettelkasten is a complex form of metacognitive activity. It requires active thinking,
taking notes and also revisiting the notes regularly with an intention to find new and better
connections.
