I never like it when someone, let it be a friend or a lover, says, "I can't do it". For me, it should be "how can I do it?". In Rich Dad, Poor Dad, the author's attitude towards money is similar. Instead of saying "I can't afford it", ask "how can I afford it?".
Of course always keep in mind that unnecessary consumption is bad.
