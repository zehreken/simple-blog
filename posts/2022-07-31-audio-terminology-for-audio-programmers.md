### Audio Terminology for Audio Programmers
I decided to write this post  since I'll be an audio programmer in a few months
time. It is very exciting but also a little scary since I have no professional
experience as one. As an audio programmer, if you want your fellow audio
designer love you, you should know these terms.

**dB(decibel):** A unit to measure 'sound pressure level'. It is also a thing in
logarithms.

**RMS:** Root mean square. It is basically the average, but for continuous
*signals, such as audio
or electrical signals. In dBs.

**Peak:** Maximum value of an audio signal. In dBs.
