Here are some of my hobby projects.
### modul
[modul](https://github.com/zehreken/modul) is a music making program written in Rust. It might not be doing much now but the goal is creating a live performance capable music program. It currently can sample audio and loop and then record. It also has some capability to visualize each audio channel.

### TAS
[TAS](https://mogze.itch.io/tas) is a top down shooter I released in 2014 for iOS and Android. It was a very bad game from a game design perspective. I occasionally work on it to get better at game design.
