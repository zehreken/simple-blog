Here are some of my hobby projects.
### modul
[modul](https://github.com/zehreken/modul) is a music making program written in Rust. It might not be doing much now but the goal is creating a live performance capable music program. It currently can sample audio and loop and then write to disk. It also has some capability to visualize each audio channel.
Here is a video of me making not so good music with **modul**.

### TAS
[TAS](https://mogze.itch.io/tas) is a top down shooter I released in 2014 for iOS and Android. It was a very bad game from a game design perspective. I occasionally work on it to get better at game design.

### GLhelp
[GLhelp](https://lab.guchanalkan.com/glhelp) is a tool for better understanding the functions in the graphic libraries. I recently started working on this. It is written in Rust and it targets WASM.
