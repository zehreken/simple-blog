Hi, I'm Güçhan Alkan. I've been working as a programmer since 2008, almost exclusively in the games industry. I worked on 2D and 3D games for various platforms including PC, PS3 and mobile devices. I currently work as a Systems/Audio Programmer at 10 Chambers.

This website is about my journey to become a polymath.
