For the last few months, I've been doing job interviews like crazy. I get
multiple messages from recruiters every week and I'm sure many other programmers
do. There are so many new companies opening in Stockholm and around the world
and there is such a high demand for programmers. I can't really think of a
better time than now to be a programmer.

Previously I didn't reply at all or just replied no to those messages. But this
year I wanted to get experienced in interviews and I think it is one of the best
decisions I've ever made. In this post I want to talk about what I learnt after
interviewing for more than 10 different positions since the beginning of the
year.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Interviews are a great way to acknowledge your strengths and weaknesses. Frankly it
can also be hard to accept at first. It didn't take me too long to understand that
I was not good at 3D math, vectors and shaders as I used to be before joining the
mobile gaming industry. But I understood that I was good at software design patterns
and architecture. This helped me to find my focus, I started to study math, shaders
and everything 3D because my intention was returning back to console and PC gaming.

I also learnt a lot about my soft skills. The way I expressed myself in English rapidly
improved and I became more and more confident during interviews.

### Industry Knowledge
An interview is never about only the interviewee. It is also about the interviewers and
their company. It is their duty to tell you about their production processes and capabilities.
This knowledge made me a much better employee for my current company. I was full of ideas
almost about everything. It is very good feeling.

### As an Interviewer
I am also very involved in hiring technical people at my current company and I do interview
a lot of applicants for programming positions. I don't think this requires a lot of explanation.
Basically being an interviewee helped me become a better interviewer as well, it is just practice.

### Deadlines and Planning
Even though I'm a seasoned programmer and quite used to working with deadlines, programming tests
have even harder deadlines. Since I have a job already, I needed to plan ahead and work smart to
meet the test deadlines. After a few times you start to learn what would be really important for
the test and for the interviewer.

### Networking
Every interview means meeting 2 new people in the industry. You 

// This is the last item
### Happy Ending
After all thos

* You understand your strenghts and weaknesses, it can be about the profession
like skills, techniques and so on but also it can be about soft skills
* You learn about other companies', teams' processes, it is basically free
information and can be very useful for your current position and company
* I'm a senior programmer and I interview people in my company as well and being
and interviewee helped me a lot when doing interviews. It basically works both
ways. Most of the times
* Deadlines
* Networking
* You better understand what you want, talk about 

I'm not going to dive into details for each interview but I want to write more
about the similarities and differences between the interviews I had. Almost all
of the processes start with a basic screening by the recruiter to check if you
are interested and if you know how to English. Most of the jobs I was
interviewed for were Unity jobs. There was one cybersecurity position that
involved Rust. Especially the interviews for positions out of your domain are
very informative.

I tried to invest as little as possible in the process, for example if the
company wanted me to do a take home test, I rejected it. I got offered the
positions 3 times and some of the companies didn't even come back to me after
the first interview. That cybersecurity company for instance because I had zero
domain knowledge and the interview was very bad. I've never met a single person
who wasn't nice. This was great. It is encouraging to do more interviews in the
future.

You can easily find out your weaknesses and strengths. I worked on a lot of 3D
games that involved realistic physics earlier in my career and I was good at
vector math and linear algebra. Since I started working on mobile games that
were mostly puzzle games I basically forgot all the practical knowledge about
maths. I of course got better at reasoning about grids and puzzle games in
general but this shows how easy it is to lose skill that seemed virtually
impossible to happen.
