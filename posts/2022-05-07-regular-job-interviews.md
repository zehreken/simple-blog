For the last few months, I've been doing interviews like crazy. I get multiple
messages from recruiters every week -I'm sure many other programmers do, there
are so many new startups nowadays- and I usually don't reply back or just reply
no. But starting this year I wanted to get experienced in interviews and I think
it is one of the best decisions I've ever made. In this post I want to talk
about my experience doing interviews for probably more than 10 different
positions since the beginning of this year.

I'm not going to dive into details for each interview but I want to write more
about the similarities and differences between the interviews I had. Almost all
of the processes start with a basic screening by the recruiter to check if you
are interested and if you know how to English. Most of the jobs I was
interviewed for were Unity jobs. There was one cybersecurity position that
involved Rust. Especially the interviews for positions out of your domain are
very informative.

I tried to invest as little as possible in the process, for example if the
company wanted me to do a take home test, I rejected it. I got offered the
positions 3 times and some of the companies didn't even come back to me after
the first interview. That cybersecurity company for instance because I had zero
domain knowledge and the interview was very bad. I've never met a single person
who wasn't nice. This was great. It is encouraging to do more interviews in the
future.

You can easily find out your weaknesses and strengths. I worked on a lot of 3D
games that involved realistic physics earlier in my career and I was good at
vector math and linear algebra. Since I started working on mobile games that
were mostly puzzle games I basically forgot all the practical knowledge about
maths. I of course got better at reasoning about grids and puzzle games in
general but this shows how easy it is to lose skill that seemed virtually
impossible to happen.
