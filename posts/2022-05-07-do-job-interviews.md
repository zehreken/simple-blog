**For** the last few months, I've been doing job interviews like crazy. I get
multiple messages from recruiters every week and I'm sure many other programmers
do. There are so many new companies opening in Stockholm and around the world
and there is such a high demand for programmers. I can't really think of a
better time than now to be a programmer.

Previously I didn't reply at all or just replied no to those messages. But this
year I wanted to get experienced in interviews and I think it is one of the best
decisions I've ever made. In this post I want to talk about what I learnt after
interviewing for more than 10 different companies since the beginning of the
year.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Interviews are a great way to acknowledge your strengths and weaknesses. Frankly
it can also be hard to accept at first. It didn't take me too long to understand
that I was not good at 3D math, vectors and shaders as I used to be before
joining the mobile gaming industry. But I understood that I was good at software
design patterns and architecture. This helped me to find my focus, I started to
study math, shaders and everything 3D because my intention was returning back to
console and PC gaming.

I also learnt a lot about my soft skills. The way I expressed myself in English
rapidly improved and I became more and more confident during interviews.

### Industry Knowledge
An interview is never about only the interviewee. It is also about the
interviewers and their company. It is their duty to tell you about their
production processes and capabilities.  This knowledge made me a much better
employee for my current company. I was full of ideas almost about everything. It
is very good feeling.

### As an Interviewer
I am also very involved in hiring technical people at my current company and I
do interview a lot of applicants for programming positions. I don't think this
requires a lot of explanation.  Basically being an interviewee helped me become
a better interviewer as well, it is just practice.

### Deadlines and Planning
Even though I'm a seasoned programmer and quite used to working with deadlines,
programming tests have even harder deadlines. Since I have a job already, I
needed to plan ahead and work smart to meet the test deadlines. After a few
times you start to learn what would be really important for the test and for the
interviewer.

### Networking
Every interview means meeting 2 new people in the industry. Interviews are a
great way to expand your network in the industry. If you are in the same city
and go to programming events, you will also meet your interviewers in real time.
It is such a nice experience.

### Knowing What You Want
As I mentioned I was interviewed by more then 10 companies and I was fortune
enough to get 3 offers that I rejected before I accepted the 4th one. I was very
close to sign a new contract but I trusted my gut feeling. Sometimes it was the
pay, sometimes it was the culture but eventually I landed on a job that I really
liked. All in all I was quite happy with the result and looking forward to my
new position in October.

### Conclusion
Interviews are very good a lot of things but they are also very demanding and
stressful and eventually you'll want them to end. In my case, I started
interviewing for fun and after 8 months I found a position that I can really
like. Do interviews if you like your current job, then you'll be a better
employee for your company. Don interviews if you don't like your current job,
then you can find something you like. There is no downsides to do interviews,
they are fun, educational and useful.
