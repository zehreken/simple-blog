### Tip #1
Your users will depend on anything you provide in your interface even if they are bugs or incorrect
implementations.

### Tip #2
Don't provide view/UI unless of course the library is about UI.

### Tip #3
Sync often with other parties. For example if you are working on a telemetry library, sync often
with the Data Analysts and also the programmers who will use it.
