I recently changed jobs. I used to work at a mobile games company as a senior programmer.
I was very comfortable at my post but I was also feeling very dissatisfied with what I did daily.
I was recently promoted to a lead position but it didn't mean anything at all.

Fast forward a couple months and I already spent 3 weeks on the new job. Time flies but this
is another topic to rent. The point of this post is how I feel very inadequate for my current position.
Even though we use Unity and C#, and I have years of experience in both, there are also so many new things. We use perforce instead of git, I feel crippled just because of that. Since I'm the audio programmer, I needed to learn Wwise. I was stressed in the first week but after 3 weeks I feel like I know enough Wwise to be productive. My current struggle is with DOTS, but in the last couple days, I have improved on that part too.

This post is not about complaining or making up excuses though. I just want to take a note that, with enough persistence, patience and presence anything is possible.

// This part is very personal, skip it, talk more about practical stuff for other people.
I feel like I have learnt more in the past 3 weeks than my whole time at MAG. Because MAG was actually a downgrade for me, now I realise that. It took me a long time to realise how comfortable it was because first; comfort is nice and second; there were other unknowns for me. Like moving to a new country, making new friends, basically creating a new life. In that sense I'm glad that I worked at MAG.
