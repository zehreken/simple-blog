**Here** is a list of stuff that I've found interesting and important while trying to learn Rust Language.

* std::mem::replace
* https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/index.html
A very good learning material, will give a deeper understanding after you finish the Rustbook.
* rustc --explain [error code]

### into_iter, iter and iter_mut
* The iterator returned by into_iter may yield any of T, &T or &mut T, depending on the context.
* The iterator returned by iter will yield &T, by convention.
* The iterator returned by iter_mut will yield &mut T, by convention.

### Conditional Compilation for Debug and Release Builds
Here is the way to conditionally compile Rust code for Debug and Release builds
```
#[cfg(debug_assertions)]
fn example() {
    println!("Debugging enabled");
}

#[cfg(not(debug_assertions))]
fn example() {
    println!("Debugging disabled");
}

fn main() {
    if cfg!(debug_assertions) {
        println!("Debugging enabled");
    } else {
        println!("Debugging disabled");
    }

    #[cfg(debug_assertions)]
    println!("Debugging enabled");

    #[cfg(not(debug_assertions))]
    println!("Debugging disabled");

    example();
}
```
